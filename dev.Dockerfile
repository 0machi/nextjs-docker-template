# One common issue that may arise is a missing shared library required for use of process.dlopen.
# To add the missing shared libraries to your image, adding the libc6-compat package in your Dockerfile is recommended: apk add --no-cache libc6-compat
RUN apk add --no-cache libc6-compat

# Install dependencies
WORKDIR /app
COPY ./package.json ./
RUN npm install
